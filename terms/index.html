<h1>Stardog Admin {#title}</h1>
<p>In the Stardog documentation, the following terms have a specific
technical meaning.</p>
<h1>Terminology {#chapter}</h1>
<p>Stardog Database Management System, aka Stardog Server, aka Stardog
:   An instance of Stardog: only one Stardog Server may run per JVM. A
    computer may run multiple Stardog Servers by running one per
    multiple JVMs.
Stardog Home, aka <code>STARDOG_HOME</code>
:   A directory in a filesystem in which Stardog stores files and other
    information; established either in a Stardog configuration file or
    by environment variable. Only one Stardog Server may run
    simultaneously from a <code>STARDOG_HOME</code>.
Stardog Network Home
:   A URL (HTTP or SNARL) which identifies a Stardog Server running on
    the network.
Database
:   A Stardog database is a graph of RDF data under management of a
    Stardog Server. It may contain zero or more RDF Named Graphs. A
    Stardog Server may manage more than one Database; there is no hard
    limit, and the practical limit is disk space.
Database Short Name, aka Database Name
:   An identifier used to name a database, provided as input when a
    database is created.
Database Network Name
:   A Database Short Name is part of the URI of a Database addressed
    over some network protocol.
Index
:   The unit of persistence for a Database. We sometimes (sloppily) use
    Database and Index interchangeably in the Stardog docs.
Memory Database
:   A Database may be stored in-memory or on disk; a Memory Database is
    read entirely into system memory but can be (optionally) persisted
    to disk.
Disk Database
:   A Disk Database is only paged into system memory as needed and is
    persisted using one or more indexes.
Connection String
:   An identifier (a restricted subset of legal URLs, actually) that is
    used to connect to a Stardog database to send queries or perform
    other operations.
Named Graph
:   A Named Graph is an explicitly named unit of data within a Database.
    Named Graphs are queries explicitly by specifying them in SPARQL
    queries. There is no practical limit on the number of Named Graphs
    in a Database.
Default Graph
:   The Default Graph in a Database is the context into which RDF
    triples are stored when a Named Graph is not explicitly specified. A
    SPARQL query executed by Stardog that does not contain any Named
    Graph statements is executed against the data in the Default Graph
    only.
Security Realm
:   A Security Realm defines the users and their permissions for each
    Database in an Stardog Server. There is only one Security Realm per
    Stardog Server.</p>
