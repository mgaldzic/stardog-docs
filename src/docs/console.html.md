## Introduction 

Stardog 2.0 introduces the Web Console, a responsive web app for every Stardog database that makes administration and interaction with data quick and easy. The Console includes a Linked Data management capability--including data editing--browsing, search, query, and JMX monitoring.

### Security

The Web Console is, by default, *lightly* secured; please see the [Security](/security) chapter for how to configure security for Stardog.  If you are a first time user of the Web Console, and haven't already configured security yourself, please refer to the Default Security Configuration section of that chapter for the credentials you'll need to access the Web Console.
